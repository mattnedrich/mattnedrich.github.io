## About Me
<span style="float: left; padding-right:20px; padding-bottom:0px;"><img src="images/matt2ss.jpg"/>
</span>
I am a software engineer with an interest in computer science and mathematics. I have experience with software development, computer architecture, computer vision, and machine learning.

I have a Masters degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University, where I studied Computer Vision and Machine Learning under [Prof. James W. Davis](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~jwdavis/). My research involved scene understanding and modeling in outdoor camera networks. My thesis focused on the automatic detection and exploitation of entry and exit regions (see this [publication](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~jwdavis/Publications/MVA2012.pdf)). Additionally, I worked on several other projects including distributed camera network control, a TCP camera server for analog pan-tilt-zoom cameras, and android applications that leveraged GPS and outdoor camera networks.

I am currently a Software Engineer at Intel where I work on tools that help characterize CPUs and SoCs.

## About this site
I created this site to write about topics that I'm interested in to help myself understand them better. Maybe one day someone will stumble upon my site and find it interesting.
