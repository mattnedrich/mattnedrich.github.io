## Current Projects
<hr/>
#### **<font color='gray'>MOOCs</font>**

Not necessarily a development project, but most of my free time goes to taking classes on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). Thus far, I have enjoyed:<br>
[Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun)<br>
[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)<br>
[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/alo2)<br>
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)<br>

#### **<font color='gray'>Algorithm and Data Structure Implementations</font>**

To familiarize myself with more algorithms and data structures I've decided to implement as many of them as possible for fun. You can find some of them here:<br>

#### **<font color='gray'>Reddit API Wrapper</font>**

I'm developing a partial wrapper around the Reddit API that allows users to access data from Reddit programmatically test:<br>

## Past Projects

#### **<font color='gray'>Research</font>**

I worked on two large projects in graduate school

- **HCI for Visual Surveillance** - project description [here]({{ root_url }}/masters_work/hci_visual_surveillance.html)
- **Scene Entry and Exit Discovery** - project description [here]({{ root_url }}/masters_work/scene_entry_exit_discovery.html)

#### **<font color='gray'>Photo Mosaic Creator</font>**

I've developed a [photo mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic) creator. It allows an image to be created from a pool of other images. Eventually, I plan on cleaning it up and putting it on github.
