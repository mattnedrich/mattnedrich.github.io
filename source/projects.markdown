## Current Projects

#### **MOOCs**

Not necessarily a development project, but most of my free time goes to taking classes on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org). Thus far, I have enjoyed:<br>
[Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun)<br>
[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)<br>
[Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/alo2)<br>
[Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml)<br>

#### **Algorithm Implementations**

As an effort to familiarize myself with more algorithms and data structures, and to reinforce my current understanding, I've decided to implement as many of them as possible for fun. You can find some of them here:<br>

## Past Projects

#### **Photo Mosaic Creator**
I've developed a [photo mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic) creator. It allows an image to be created from a pool of other images. Eventually, I plan on cleaning it up and putting it on github.

#### **Research**

I worked on two large projects in graduate school

- **HCI for Visual Surveillance** - project description [here]({{ root_url }}/masters_work/hci_visual_surveillance.html)
- **Scene Entry and Exit Discovery** - project description [here]({{ root_url }}/masters_work/scene_entry_exit_discovery.html)
