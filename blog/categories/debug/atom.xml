    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often open command windows on Windows via <code>shift + right click</code> on a directory. It’s a handy way to open a cmd window right where you want one. Ironically the option directly below <code>Open command window here</code> is <code>Open as Notebook in OneNote</code>. I accidentally clicked the OneNote option and it turned out to be a pretty interesting 10 pixel mistake.</p>

<p><img width="250px" src="/images/onenote_fun/onenote_cmd_window.jpg" /></p>

<p>Some backstory - my original intent was to open a cmd window to the source directory of my blog to build it (I’m using Octopress). At first it wasn’t clear what clicking the OneNote option actually did. However, after a little poking around I was seeing a <code>OneNote Table Of Content.onetoc2</code> file in every directory of my blog output. That is, I didn’t see these in the blog source directory, but every time I would build my blog they would show up in <strong>every</strong> output directory.</p>

<p>I tried grepping for interesting files/directories in the blog source, but nothing showed up. I tried manually browsing through the source directory structure. Also note that I had show hidden files and folders turned on. Still, I found nothing.</p>

<p>After some digging, and a lot of help from this <a href="http://www.tigraine.at/2009/09/01/howto-get-rid-of-onetoc2-files-using-powershell">post</a> it turns out that there were several OneNote files embedded and hidden in every directory of my blog source. The only way I was able to see them was to display them in a cmd window via</p>

  <div class="code"><pre>
dir /A:H /B
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>After it was clear that they were indeed there but hidden, I was able to delete them via</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
del /S /A:H *.onetoc2
</pre></div>
</div>
 </figure></notextile></div></p>
